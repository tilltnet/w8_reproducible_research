abstract = {This paper presents a computational model for measuring diversity in terms of variety, balance and disparity. This model is informed by the Stirling's framework for understanding diversity from social science and underpinned by semantic techniques from computer science. A case study in learning is used to illustrate the application of the model. It is driven by the desire to broaden learners' perspectives in an increasingly diverse and inclusive society. For example, interpreting body language in a job interview may be influenced by the different background of observers. With the explosion of digital objects on social platforms, selecting the appropriate ones for learning can be challenging and time consuming. The case study uses over 2000 annotated comments from 51 YouTube videos on job interviews. Diversity indicators are produced based on the comments for each video, which in turn facilitate the ranking of the videos according to the degree of diversity in the comments for the selected domain.},

The paper reports on empirical findings derived from classroom interventions which were undertaken to investigate the impact of the proposed strategy. For each intervention, an adaptive e-course was developed and tested with encouraging results. Since the proposed strategy is descriptive in nature the paper can be used as the basis for future studies that validate it with other subject matters than those mentioned herein.},

abstract = {Research on technology acceptance in educational contexts often shows little or no influence of user acceptance on use intention or use behavior. While recent attempts to factor in learners' motivation appear promising, the problem of limited explanatory value of technology acceptance models remains. This paper further explores the relationship between motivational and acceptance factors in different learning contexts. Data (N = 673) from four studies conducted among users of two online learning environments at a major university in Germany are analyzed using a combined data set containing items relating to user motivation (according to Self-Determination Theory) and technology acceptance (according to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology). The data show significant differences in acceptance and motivational levels between these four groups, as well as a connection between acceptance and motivation. Implications of these results include a recommendation to revisit UTAUT assumptions and variables in future research.},

We evaluate the mobile grading process and the quality of grading results based on the assessed semantic information. The results demonstrate that the mobile grading approach keeps persistent traces of students' performance, including semantic feedback and ultimately enhances grading consistency.},

This work intends to introduce a tool for teaching, evaluating, and assessing computer science students. Kodr is a modular gamified learning platform designed to evaluate varying problem types through gathering data about students performance. We conducted two studies in the wild with more than one thousand students to evaluate the initial design of Kodr. The first study evaluated two methods of teaching. The first method is to solve programming problems from scratch, the second, is to debug an incorrect solution of those problems. The results of the study yielded no significant difference between the two styles. The second study found significant positive correlations between Kodr's activity data and student's final course grades. Qualitative feedback gathered from students also evaluated Kodr as quite helpful.},

abstract = {In recent years, a number of recommendation algorithms have been proposed to help learners find suitable learning resources on-line. Next to user-centered evaluations, offline-datasets have been used to investigate new recommendation algorithms or variations of collaborative filtering approaches. However, a more extensive study comparing a variety of recommendation strategies on multiple TEL datasets is missing. In this work, we contribute with a data-driven study of recommendation strategies in TEL to shed light on their suitability for TEL datasets. To that end, we evaluate six state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms for tag and resource recommendations on six empirical datasets: a dataset from European Schoolnets TravelWell, a dataset from the MACE portal, which features access to meta-data-enriched learning resources from the field of architecture, two datasets from the social bookmarking systems BibSonomy and CiteULike, a MOOC dataset from the KDD challenge 2015, and Aposdle, a small-scale workplace learning dataset. We highlight strengths and shortcomings of the discussed recommendation algorithms and their applicability to the TEL datasets. Our results demonstrate that the performance of the algorithms strongly depends on the properties and characteristics of the particular dataset. However, we also find a strong correlation between the average number of users per resource and the algorithm performance. A tag recommender evaluation experiment reveals that a hybrid combination of a cognitive-inspired and a popularity-based approach consistently performs best on all TEL datasets we utilized in our study.},

abstract = {In online learning platforms such as MOOCs, computerized assessment needs to be optimized in order to prevent boredom and dropout of learners. Indeed, they should spend as little time as possible in tests and still receive valuable feedback. It is actually possible to reduce the number of questions for the same accuracy with computerized adaptive testing (CAT): asking the next question according to the past performance of the examinee. CAT algorithms are divided in two categories: summative CATs, that measure the level of examinees, and formative CATs, that provide feedback to the examinees at the end of the test by specifying which knowledge components need further work. In this paper, we formalize the problem of test-size reduction by predicting student performance, and propose a new hybrid CAT algorithm GenMA based on the general diagnostic model, that is both summative and formative. Using real datasets, we compare our model to popular CAT models and show that GenMA achieves better accuracy while using fewer questions than the existing models.},

Results of the year-end evaluation of this model showed positive student perceptions. An analysis of covariance of the algebra post-test score with learning model as treatment factor and pre-test as covariate resulted in a significant treatment effect at .05 level of significance. A paired-sample t-test by treatment group to compare pre-test and post-test math attitude scores resulted in a significant decrease in the control groups' value of mathematics while the experimental group had a significant positive change in their confidence and enjoyment of mathematics.},

Many ITSs provide student performance reports, but they may not be designed to serve teachers' needs well, which is important for a well-designed dashboard. We investigated what student data is most helpful to teachers and how they use data to adjust and individualize instruction. Specifically, we conducted Contextual Inquiry interviews with teachers and used Interpretation Sessions and Affinity Diagramming to analyze the data. We found that teachers generate data on students' concept mastery, misconceptions and errors, and utilize data provided by ITSs and other software. Teachers use this data to drive instruction and remediate issues on an individual and class level. Our study uncovers how data can support teachers in helping students learn and provides a solid foundation and recommendations for designing a teacher's dashboard.},
